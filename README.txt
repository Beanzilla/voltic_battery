# Voltic Battery

A Voltic Battery is able to produce a small amount of charge on it's own, without anything except the standard stuff (requires a Switch Station).

## Required

All you really need is technic, though I do have support (just like technic does) for digilines.

## Why

So I was thinking of something to add to technic, just as a fun extra to include... and here this mod is.

The point of this is so you could build a quick base to do things like charge your tools or to power something that doesn't eat the power quickly.
