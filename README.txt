# Voltic Battery

Voltic Batteries are essentially the mix of a small bioreactor and a battery.

Thus it produces a small but continuous amount of power. (Or commonly also known as free energy)

The Bioreactor is simply a device that produces more free energy.

But is fairly expensive in terms of construction.
